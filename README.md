Face Expression Recognition with Deep Learning

The Facial Expression Recognition system is the process of identifying the emotional state of a person. In this, the system through webcam continuously monitors the facial expression of the person and depending upon that it tells the emotional state of a person.

The model through the webcam extracts frames out of it, then this frame is then being sent to our trained CNN (Convolution Neural Network) model that will categorize the facial expression into 7 categories:-
                1)	Angry
                2)	Disgust
                3)	Fear
                4)	Happy
                5)	Neutral
                6)	Sad
                7)	Surprise

Here for training our model we have used Convolution Neural Network (CNN) which is specially being used when our dataset has a grid like topology just like an image. CNN has high accuracy because of which it can be used for image recognition.
